# 🏫 Challenge: Typesetting a Community School Homepage

---

In this challenge, you'll style the text for a community school's homepage, testing your understanding of various text styling techniques.

## 📝 Starting Point

---

-   **Get the files:** Grab the HTML and CSS files for the exercise, along with the provided external link icon, and save them on your local computer.
-   **Alternative:** Use an online editor like CodePen or JSFiddle. Paste the HTML and CSS, and use the external link icon as a background image.

## 📋 Project Brief

---

You are provided with raw HTML and basic CSS. Your task is to add new CSS below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file.

### Fonts ✒️

-   Download two free-to-use fonts: a serif font for general body text and a sans-serif or slab serif for headings, to create a formal, trustworthy feel.
-   Generate `@font-face` code.
-   Apply the body font to the entire page and the heading font to your headings.

### General Text Styling 🎨

-   Set a site-wide `font-size` of 10px.
-   Use relative units for heading `font-sizes`.
-   Give body text a suitable `line-height`.
-   Center the top-level heading.
-   Add a little `letter-spacing` to headings and body text.
-   Add `word-spacing` to body text.
-   Give the first paragraph after each `<section>` heading a `text-indentation` of 20px.

### Links 🔗

-   Style `link`, `visited`, `focus`, and `hover` states with colors that match the page's horizontal bars.
-   Underline links by default, but make the underline disappear on hover or focus.
-   Remove the default focus outline from all links.
-   Give the `active` state a distinct, yet harmonizing, style.
-   Insert an external link icon next to external links.

### Lists 📜

-   Ensure list spacing works well with the overall page design.
-   Match list item `line-height` to paragraph line-height.
-   Match the spacing above and below lists to paragraph spacing.
-   Use a custom bullet image or a different bullet style.

### Navigation Menu 🧭

-   Style the navigation menu to harmonize with the page.
-   Make it a vertical nav menu and ensure it's tall enough.

## 💡 Hints and Tips

---

-   No need to edit the HTML.
-   The nav menu does not have to look like buttons, but it must be a vertical menu and tall enough to look right on the page.

### ‚ú® Images, Media, and Form Elements

This lesson covers how certain special elements like **images, media, and forms** are treated differently by CSS compared to regular boxes. Understanding these differences can prevent frustration when styling.

### üìù Key Concepts

  * **Replaced Elements:** Images and video are "replaced elements," meaning CSS can't control their internal layout, only their position. They have an intrinsic **aspect ratio** (horizontal and vertical size).
  * **Sizing Images:** To prevent image overflow within a container, a common technique is to set **`max-width: 100%`**.
  * **`object-fit` Property:** Use this property to control how a replaced element fits inside its container.
      * **`cover`**: Scales the image to fill the box while maintaining the aspect ratio, which may crop parts of the image.
      * **`contain`**: Scales the image down until it fits inside the box, which may result in "letterboxing."
      * **`fill`**: Fills the box but does not maintain the aspect ratio.
  * **Layout Differences:** Replaced elements do not stretch to fill grid areas by default; instead, they align to the start of their areas to avoid strange distortion.

### üöß Styling Form Elements

Form elements can be tricky to style because their default appearance often depends on the user's operating system and browser.

  * **Styling Text Inputs:** Elements like `<input type="text">`, `<input type="email">`, and `<textarea>` are relatively easy to style and behave like regular boxes.
  * **Normalization:** To ensure consistent styling across different browsers and operating systems, developers use a "form reset" to set a baseline.
      * **Font Inheritance**: Add `font-family: inherit` and `font-size: 100%` to ensure fonts are inherited.
      * **Box Sizing**: Use `box-sizing: border-box` to unify how padding and borders affect sizing.
      * **Textarea Overflow**: Set `overflow: auto` on `<textarea>` to prevent unnecessary scrollbars.

### üí° Form Reset Code

```css
button,
input,
select,
textarea {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

textarea {
  overflow: auto;
}
```
